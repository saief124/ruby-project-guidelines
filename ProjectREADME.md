# Personal Fitness Blog

This project allows us to connect a user with a workout trainer and allow the user to keep track of workout details, change plans, check status of their weight loss journey.

The user is introduced with a welcome_message displaying "Welcome to Fitness Blogger" then prompts the user asking them if they are a registered member of the fitness blog. We check the database if the name they input has been register with us, if it hasn't been registered the user is prompted to make an account. 

After the user creates an account, they are brought to the existing_users screen, where the method acts as a main menu for the blog. Users are introduced to many options ranging from creating a workout, checking status of their weight loss journey, setting up a workout with a specific trainer, and more.
